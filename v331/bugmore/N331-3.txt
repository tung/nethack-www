We have received several reports of NetHack crashing after the installation of
Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 (SP2).  The fix is to reinstall NetHack.

Previously saved games will still work.

The crash is caused by an interaction between the OS and the code
produced by the compiler used to produce the NetHack executable;
no changes to the NetHack source are involved.
