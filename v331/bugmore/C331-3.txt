Annotation C331-3.1 August 14 2000

In the previous version, 3.3.0, the selection routines would prompt
you for information that conflicted with some of the other selections
that you had made.  In some cases it silently ignored some 
information.  That drew a fair bit of feedback. 

In 3.3.1, each attribute chosen filters the choices for the next selection 
so that there are no conflicts.  For instance, if you have chosen
OPTIONS=gender:male in your config file, Valkyrie won't be present
on the role selection menu.  That's because Valkyries can only be
female.  You can override the setting in the config file by specifying
	-p Valkyrie
on the command line to choose a Valkyrie explicitly.  
Alternatively, you can remove the OPTIONS=gender:male from your 
config file, so that it does not limit your startup selection choices.
	
(Note that OPTIONS=gender:male in the config file could also 
be enabled by the deprecated OPTIONS=male, or 
OPTIONS=!female.  You should use the OPTIONS=gender
method for choosing your gender in NetHack 3.3.x)
