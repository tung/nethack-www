Annotation M331-1.1 August 13 2000
    Some Macintosh users were getting type -108 (out of memory)
    errors (bug M331-1).  The new 3.3.1 packaging of the Macintosh
    binaries, released on August 13, 2000, fixes this problem by
    doubling the application's memory allocation.  It also corrects
    the version number reported by the Finder's Get Info command
    (bug M331-2).  These are the ONLY changes in the new package.

    If you have already downloaded the original package, you should
    fix this problem yourself.  Select the application program in
    the Finder, select "Get Info" from the File menu, and replace
    the Memory Requirements with double their values.  Please do
    this rather than wasting your time and our bandwidth downloading
    the new package.  Be considerate or else we will not make these
    types of updates available in the future.

    Note that the game is known to work just fine on some Macs,
    even with the smaller memory allocation.  So if you have an
    older Mac with limited memory, you probably can get away with
    the smaller memory allocation.
