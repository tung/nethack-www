Annotation C331-2.1 August 11 2000

The XXX_player_selection() routine was determining that information
was missing, so it prompted "Shall I pick a character for you?". 
Later processing ruled out all possible selections except one, so
no further prompting for the missing information took place. In
the reported situation, the missing information was race and 
alignment, but Knights can only be Human and Lawful.
