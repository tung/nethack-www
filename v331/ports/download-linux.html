If you are running Redhat Linux 7.x, you will have to build from
<a href="../download-src.html">source</a>, these
binaries will <em>not</em> work.  Note that the Redhat-supplied binary
for 7.2 was built incorrectly and can't save and restore properly.

NetHack 3.3.1 Linux Elf
<br>
This binary has support for tty and X11 windowing systems, but not Qt.
This means you will need to have X11 libraries installed on your system
to run this binary, even in its tty flavor.

Additional details about the Linux binary.  If you are not running Redhat,
check the <it>System</it> information in this file to see if you need to build
from
<a href="../download-src.html">source</a>,
instead of using these binaries.

<strike>(See our <a href="../../common/links.html">links</a> page for other (unofficial) Linux
binaries.)</strike>
<li><h3>Step 2: unpack.</h3>
gunzip and untar (use -p to preserve ownerships and permissions) the
package from / to put the NetHack files in
/usr/games/nethack and /usr/games/lib/nethackdir.
<p>
(If you have old record and logfile entries from a previous NetHack
version, you might want to save copies before they get overwritten by the
new empty files; old saved games and bones files won't work with 3.3.1.)
<li><h3>Step 3: install.</h3>
In addition to data files for running the game, you will find other useful
things in /usr/games/lib/nethackdir (such as a copy of this README :-).
<p>
The general documentation Guidebook.txt and the processed man pages
nethack.txt and recover.txt should provide an introduction to the game.
<p>
The sample config file called dot.nethackrc can be used by copying
it to your home directory as .nethackrc and modifying it to your liking.
<p>
If you are running X11 copy the nh10.pcf and ibm.pcf font files from
/usr/games/lib/nethackdir to a X11 fonts directory (such as
/usr/X11/lib/X11/fonts/misc) and run "mkfontdir", then restart X
windows to load them.  Also consider putting NetHack.ad in
/usr/X11/lib/X11/app-defaults or its contents in your .Xdefaults or
.Xresources.
