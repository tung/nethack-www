<dd>Intel WIN32 console binary distribution.  This may be used
                 on Intel machines running Windows NT 4.0 or later,
                 and Intel machines running Windows 95.
This is a TTY (plain text only) port of NetHack which uses the WIN32 console

if you want the version that uses tiles (the pretty graphics pictures),
download the
