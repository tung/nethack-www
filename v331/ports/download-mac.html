<li><h3>Step 2: unpack.</h3>
Unpack the archive downloaded in step 1 using Stuffit Expander or a similar
utility.
<li><h3>Step 3: install.</h3>
Read the Guidebook for a general description of what NetHack is and how to
play.  Unfortunately, the Guidebook is > 32K, so you will need something other
than SimpleText to view it.  Edit the file NetHack Defaults in this directory
to modify startup options.  Feel free to turn off News when you get
tired of seeing its message when you start up.
<p>
If you have an older Mac with limited memory, you may need to decrease the
memory allocated to the game.
Select the NetHack application program in the Finder, and choose Get Info
from the File menu.  In the "Memory Requirements" section of the resulting
window, halve the numbers which are displayed, then close the Info window.
