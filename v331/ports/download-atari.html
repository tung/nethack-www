<li><h3>Step 2: unpack.</h3>
These files can be unpacked with any standard lharc utility, which
should be used when you have set your current directory to the location
where you want to place NetHack.<br>
Make sure you create the subdirectories by applying the /x switch,
i.e.: lha e /x nh331gt.lzh.
<li><h3>Step 3: install.</h3>
Read the Guidebook for a general description of what NetHack is and how to play.

is not commented with a <tt>#</tt>.

Run nethack.prg.
