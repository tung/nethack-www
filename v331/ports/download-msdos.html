<li><h3>Step 1: download.</h3>
Official NetHack 3.3.1 binaries for Intel 386 compatible machines running
DOS.
In general, the protected mode binary 
is recommended, except where a machine has very limited memory resources, 
or does not have at least a '386 processor.

<dd>This contains the protected-mode version of NetHack built with djgpp V2. It
	requires at least 3MB extended memory and at least 2.8MB
	of free hard drive space to unzip. It requires DPMI to run,
	and includes CWSDPMI for those that don't already have
	DPMI. A '386 or greater processor is needed.  This binary fixes bug
	<a href="../bugs.html#N331-3">N331-3</a>.

This contains the real-mode overlaid version of NetHack. At least 3.7MB of
free hard drive space is required to unzip.  A minimum of 530K base RAM and
at least 2MB of free hard drive space will be required to play the game.
We've had one report that it will work on an 80286, or even an emulated
8086 (but that gets very very slow).

<li><h3>Step 2: unpack.</h3>
These files can be unpacked with any standard unzipping utility, which
should be used when you have set your current directory to the location
where you want to place NetHack.
<li><h3>Step 3: configure.</h3>
Edit the defaults.nh to your liking.  The default settings use ascii
graphics. If you prefer a 16 colour tiled display, ensure that the line
OPTIONS=video:autodetect is not commented with a #.
<li><h4>Step 4: run.</h3>
Run NetHack.exe.
<p>
See the file README in the top level directory unpacked in Step 2 for
additional installation instructions.
