## MS-DOS

[nh331rm2.zip](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nethack/files/nethack/3.3.1/nh331rm2.zip/download)
: This contains the real-mode overlaid version of NetHack.  At least 3.7MB of free hard drive space is required to unzip.  A minimum of 530K base RAM and at least 2MB of free hard drive space will be required to play the game.  We've had one report that it will work on an 80286, or even an emulated 8086 (but that gets very very slow).
