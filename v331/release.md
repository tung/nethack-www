title: Release Notes
---
NetHack 3.3.1 is an enhancement to the dungeon exploration game NetHack.  It is a distant descendent of Rogue and Hack, and a direct descendent of NetHack 3.2 and 3.3.0.

This version fixes many, many bugs and focuses primarily on stabilizing the features and changes introduced to the game in 3.3.0.  A security fix is also included as well as a few extra surprises.

Here is a brief overview of new additions and changes to the game.  To give more would be cheating, wouldn't it?

* New warning system that is more pleasant than the old one
* Restored Amiga port functionality courtesy Janne Salmijarvi
* Restored Atari port functionality courtesy Christian "Marvin" Bressler
* The Gnome toolkit interface is now offered as an experimental option that was recently rolled into the NetHack source tree

-- Good luck, and happy Hacking --
