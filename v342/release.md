title: Release Notes
---
The NetHack DevTeam is pleased to announce the release of NetHack 3.4.2, the second bugfix release for NetHack 3.4.  This release contains more than one hundred general bug fixes (see below), as well as the following more specific items:

* Fixed a fatal bug that triggered a panic when your secondary weapon was cursed during bones file creation
* Fixed a fatal bug that caused a crash when applying figurine, candle, or bell that gets used up
* Fixed message ordering for several actions
* Fixed some Gnome compilation problems on Redhat 7.2 and 8.0
* Fixed a problem in the util Makefile
* use random() by default under linux instead of lrand48()
* win32 tty adjustments and support for loading alternative key handlers

A more complete list of changes for this release can be found in the file `doc/fixes34.2` in the source distribution.  The text in this file was written for the development team's use and is provided "as is", so please do not ask us to further explain the entries in that file.

The NetHack 3.4.2 source code supports many different platforms including most Unix versions.  In addition to source code support, we expect to supply binaries for Windows, DOS, Linux (tm), Apple Macintosh (tm), Apple Macintosh OS X (tm), OS/2 (tm), Atari (tm), Amiga (tm), Handheld PC Professional devices running Windows 2.11 or higher, PocketPC platform devices (Windows CE 3.0, PocketPC 2000 and PocketPC 2002), and Palm Size PC 1.1 devices running Windows CE 2.11.

To download the game, go to the NetHack website and download from the downloads page at: <http://www.nethack.org/v342/downloads.html>.  Mirrors may be available in your area, or if your software doesn't get along with the primary site(s).

See the following web page for a current list of mirrors: <http://www.nethack.org/common/links.html#mirror>

Binaries for a given platform may take a day or so to become available.  Please be patient and don't log a problem report if a specific binary release isn't immediately available.

Also, note that the Gnome toolkit interface, despite continued work, is still considered an experimental option at this point in time.

Good news!  The internal structure of bones and save files has not changed between NetHack 3.4.1 and 3.4.2.  If you use the same compiler, and the same compile-time options, and you have not incorporated any additional patches into 3.4.1 that altered the 3.4.1 save file format on your system, then bones and save files from 3.4.1 should be compatible with 3.4.2.

Official 3.4.2 binaries (those obtained from www.nethack.org or one of its mirrors) should be compatible with save and bones files created from official 3.4.1 binaries, at least in the forward direction (using save/bones files generated by 3.4.1 with 3.4.2 binaries).

If you're compiling yourself, you need to guard against clobbering existing save and/or bones files when using `make install`.

As with all releases of the game, we appreciate your feedback.  Please submit any bugs using the problem report sheet at <http://www.nethack.org/common/contact.html>.

Also, please check the "known bugs" list at <http://www.nethack.org/v342/bugs.html> before you log a problem - somebody else may have already found it, after all.

Happy NetHacking!

For the DevTeam...
