## Windows

[nh342win3.zip](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nethack/files/nethack/3.4.2/nh342win3.zip/download)
: Contains two executables - an Intel Win32 tty console executable and an Intel Win32 Graphical Interface executable.  This may be used on Intel machines running Windows 95, 98, Me, NT 4.0, Windows 2000, and Windows XP.

**Some people have attempted to run the game from *inside* an unzip utility - this will not work.  You *must* extract the contents of the .zip file to a new folder and run the game from that folder.**

**Do not copy the game to your desktop; create a shortcut instead.**

## Linux

If you have problems running these binaries due to missing libraries, check the System information in the [README.linux](README.linux.txt) file for a list of dependencies.

[nh342lin.tgz](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nethack/files/nethack/3.4.2/nh342lin.tgz/download)
: NetHack 3.4.2 Linux Elf with TTY and Athena-widget-based (traditional X11) graphics interfaces (including tiles).  This version requires glibc-2.3 and X11 libraries.

## MS-DOS

[nh342dos.zip](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nethack/files/nethack/3.4.2/nh342dos.zip/download)
: This contains the protected-mode version of NetHack built with DJGPP V2.  It requires at least 3MB extended memory and at least 2.8MB of free hard drive space to unzip.  A '386 or greater processor is needed.

It requires DPMI to run.  If you want to run it on plain DOS you can get [CWSDPMI](http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/dl/ofc/simtel/v2misc/csdpmi5b.zip), unpack it, and put the CWSDPMI executable in your NetHack directory.

Note: There is no real-mode overlaid binary distribution of NetHack 3.4.2.

## Windows CE

These installer packages must be downloaded to, and run on, a Microsoft Windows computer, not on the target Windows CE system.

: Experimental NetHack 3.4.2 installer package for the *Smartphone 2002*.  This is an *unsigned* CAB so you will need an *unlocked* version of your phone to install it and run the program (e.g. a *developer* version of the Orange SPV).  It has never been tried on the actual device so your feedback is greatly appreciated.

The installer packages above were created with [EZSetup by Scott Ludwig](http://www.scottlu.com/Content/EZSetup.html).
