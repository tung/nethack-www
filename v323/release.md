title: Release Notes
---
3.2.3 is a stop-gap source patch release for those people that were not ready to move to 3.3 either because they have games in progress or because there is no 3.3 support for their platform; the patch addresses Y2K and a few nasty bugs only - there are no new features in 3.2.3.  Everyone else should use 3.3.0.

You only need 3.2.3 if you currently have 3.2.2 installed and wish to continue to play saved games (3.3.0 is not compatible with games saved under 3.2.2 or 3.2.3); or if you play on a platform that is no longer supported.  These platforms are:

* Amiga <strike>(See the links page for unofficial binaries.)</strike>
* Atari <strike>(See the links page for unofficial binaries.)</strike>
