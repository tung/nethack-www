<li><h3>Step 2: unpack.</h3>
These files can be unpacked with any standard lharc utility, which
should be used when you have set your current directory to the location
where you want to place NetHack.<br>
Make sure you create the subdirectories by applying the /x switch,
i.e.: lha e /x nh341gt.lzh.
<li><h3>Step 3: install.</h3>
Read the Guidebook for a general description of what NetHack is and how to play.
<br>Edit nethack.cnf to adjust your settings preferences.  The default settings 
use a 16 colour tiled display.
<br>If you prefer the tty-display ensure that the line
<tt>OPTIONS=windowtype=tty,rawio,BIOS</tt>
is not commented with a <tt>#</tt>.
<li><h3>Step 4: run.</h3>
Run nethack.prg.
<p>
Refer to the file readme, the comments in nethack.cnf and the GuideBook within 
the lha-archive file for further instructions.
