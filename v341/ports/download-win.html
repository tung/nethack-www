<li><h3>Step 2: unpack.</h3>
These files can be unpacked with any standard unzipping utility, which
should be used when you have set your current directory to the location
where you want to place NetHack.
<p>
Some people have attempted to run the game from inside an unzip utility -
this will <em>not</em> work.  You must extract the contents of the .zip file
to a new folder and run the game from that folder.
<li><h3>Step 3: edit.</h3>
Edit defaults.nh to adjust your settings preferences.
<li><h3>Step 4: run.</h3>
<dl>
<dt>nethack.exe
<dd>for the tty interface
<dt>nethackw.exe
<dd>for the graphical interface
</dl>
Save and bone files are compatible between these two executables.
<p>
Refer to the file README within the zip file for further installation
instructions and release notes. 
<p>
This updated binary includes a way to alter keyboard 
key values being returned to NetHack from the operating
system.  It is hoped that this helps with problems reported
with Finnish and other international keyboard arrangements.
The included defaults.nh file has some samples for Finnish keyboards.
<p>
If the game halts with one of these <a name="cc">messages</a>:
<pre>
    Common control library is missing.
    Common control library is outdated.
</pre>
then you need to apply the

<br>

    A set of 32 x 32 tiles (that is, larger than the default graphics set).
    To install it, unzip the contents into the same directory as
    nethackw.exe, and add the following line to your defaults.nh:
<pre>
 OPTIONS=tile_file:tiles32.bmp, tile_width:32, tile_height:32
