The NetHack DevTeam is pleased to announce the release of NetHack 3.4.0.

NetHack 3.4 is an enhancement to the dungeon exploration game NetHack.  It is a distant descendent of Rogue and Hack, and a direct descendent of NetHack 3.3.

There are a great number of bug fixes in this release, as well as many changes and surprises beyond what you see listed below.  Here is a brief overview of some new additions and changes in the game.

* Many, many bug fixes and tweaks to the core code and to several ports
* Enhanced config file processing and player selection prompts for some ports
* Stamina affects ability to throw heavy things
* Objects merge in containers
* Wish for "nothing", and genocide "none" to preserve your conduct
* Several small refinements to race/role separation
* Config file BOULDER option to specify the symbol for displaying boulders
* Riding has been improved
* New travel command which is particularly helpful for mouse navigation on handheld computers
* more feedback about skill advancement from #enhance command
* End-of-game disclose options can be individually tuned to your liking
* Mac: command-key shortcuts in the player selection dialog
* Amiga: screenmode requester
* Win32: new graphical interface contributed by Alex Kompel

We've also included variations of enhancements contributed by members of the NetHack community at large.  Among them:

* Scott Bigham's new T-shirt messages and his option to turn off resistance display effects
* Malcolm Ryan's option for "autodig"
* Jay Tilton's full-screen message window display via control-P
* Dylan O'Donnell's patch for optionally starting with no pet
* Tom Friedetzky's blessed/uncursed/cursed selection patch for menustyle:full
* Jason Short's additional lens uses
* Kelly Bailey's Gnomish Mines changes
* Ken Arnold's patch to display prices in your inventory

A fuller list of changes for this release can be found in the file doc/fixes34.0 in the source distribution.  The text in there was written for the development team's own use and is provided "as is", so please do not ask us to further explain the entries in this file.

The NetHack 3.4.0 source code supports many different platforms including most Unix versions, Windows, DOS, Linux, Apple Macintosh (tm), Apple Macintosh OS X (tm), OS/2 (tm), Atari (tm), OpenVMS, and Amiga (tm).

Also, note that the Gnome toolkit interface is still considered an experimental option.  We have not enhanced the port ourselves (except for a work-around for setuid/setgid issues), and so far we have not received any contributions doing so from the NetHack community.

-- Happy NetHacking! --
