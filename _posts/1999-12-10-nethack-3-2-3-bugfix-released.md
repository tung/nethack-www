3.2.3 is a stop-gap source patch release for those people that were not ready to move to 3.3 either because they have games in progress or because there is no 3.3 support for their platform; the patch addresses Y2K and a few nasty bugs only - there are no new features in 3.2.3.  Everyone else should use 3.3.0.
