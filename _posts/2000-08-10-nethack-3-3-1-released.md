NetHack 3.3.1 is an enhancement to the dungeon exploration game NetHack. It is a distant descendent of Rogue and Hack, and a direct descendent of NetHack 3.2 and 3.3.0.

This version fixes many, many bugs and focuses primarily on stabilizing the features and changes introduced to the game in 3.3.0. A security fix is also included as well as a few extra surprises.
