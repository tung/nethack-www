title: Release Notes

NetHack 3.3 is a new enhancement to the dungeon exploration game NetHack.  It is a distant descendent of Rogue and Hack, and a direct descendent of NetHack 3.2.

Here is a brief overview of new additions and changes in the game.  To give more would be cheating, wouldn't it?

* Many, many bug fixes and minor tweaks
* Incorporate the wizard patch by Larry Stewart Zerba and Warwick Allison
* Split the character's race from his/her/its role in life
* Add elf, dwarf, orc, and gnome races
* Add new Ranger role

-- Good luck, and happy Hacking --
