  This file packaged with InfoZip 5.x contains a 32-bit binary built
  using EMX 0.9d and requires the EMX runtime libraries and dynamically
  linked against the XFree86 libraries for OS/2.  It requires that these
  libraries along with XAW.dll be installed to function and will run in
  both text mode and X11 tiles mode.
