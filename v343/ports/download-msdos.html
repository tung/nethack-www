<ul>
<li><h3>Step 1: download.</h3>
Official NetHack 3.4.3 binaries for Intel 386 compatible machines running
DOS or Windows 3.1.
In general we recommend the <a href="download-win.html">Windows version</a>
if your machine can run it.
<br>
<font color=green>
Note that it is no longer necessary to use this binary to get a graphical
interface.  The <a href="download-win.html">Windows version</a> now
supports that functionality.

<big>nh343dos.zip</big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(about 1.1M)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp(MD5 sum: 5b825354d905c8b5ad8cfee7c6ccdca2)
<br>

This contains the protected-mode version of NetHack built with djgpp V2. It
	requires at least 3MB extended memory and at least 2.8MB
	of free hard drive space to unzip.
	A '386 or greater processor is needed. (about 1.1M)
<p>
It requires DPMI to run.  If you want to run it
on plain DOS you can get
<a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/dl/ofc/simtel/v2misc/csdpmi5b.zip">
CWSDPMI
</a>, unpack it, 
and put
the CWSDPMI executable in your NetHack directory.

<li><h3>Step 2: unpack.</h3>
These files can be unpacked with any standard unzipping utility, which
should be used when you have set your current directory to the location
where you want to place NetHack.
<li><h3>Step 3: configure.</h3>
Edit the defaults.nh to your liking.  The default settings use ASCII
graphics. If you prefer a 16 colour tiled display, ensure that the line
OPTIONS=video:autodetect is not commented with a #.
<li><h4>Step 4: run.</h3>
Run NetHack.exe.
<p>
See the file README in the top level directory unpacked in Step 2 for
additional installation instructions.
