Recovery instructions for MacOS X Qt port - when the game refuses to start or
has crashed.

THESE INSTRUCTIONS ASSUME YOU HAVE INSTALLED THE DMG PACKAGE RELEASED IN
OCTOBER 2009.  If you are running the older .tgz package, see the "MANUAL
RECOVERY INSTRUCTIONS" farther down this page.

1) Use the Finder to locate "NetHackQt", but DO NOT try to start the game.

2) Hold down the control key and click on "NetHackQt" - select
   "Show Package Contents"

3) Double click on "nethackdir"

4) Double click on "NetHackRecover" and follow the on-screen instructions.

5) If recover was able to save the game that was in progress when NetHackQt
   crashed or was Force Quit, the next time the game starts it will restore
   the game.

MANUAL RECOVERY INSTRUCTIONS
These instructions assume you are comfortable using Terminal.app and the
command line.  If you are not, now might be a good time to reinstall the
game using the new .dmg package instead.

1) cd into NetHack.app.  The path depends on where you installed NetHack
   originally.

2) cd nethackdir

3) rm perm_lock
   This file may not exist; that is not a problem.

4) See if there is a game to recover.  If there are files named with a number
   (your uid) followed by your Unix user name, there is.  (Hint: use the "id"
   command to find this information.)

   To attempt recovery of the game, enter this command, substituting as
   appropriate:
	./recover -d . <UID><USERNAME>
   for example:
	./recover -d . 604shelly
