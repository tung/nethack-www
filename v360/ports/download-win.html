<li><h3>Step 2: unpack.</h3>
These files can be unpacked with any standard unzipping utility, which
should be used when you have set your current directory to the location
where you want to place NetHack.

Some people have attempted to run the game from inside an unzip utility -
this will <font color=red>not</font> work. You <font color=red>must</font>
extract the contents of the .zip file to a new
folder and run the game from that folder.  <font color=red>Do not remove (or
copy) the executable from the folder</font> (you can create a shortcut to it
instead).
<li><h3>Step 3: edit.</h3>
Edit defaults.nh to adjust your settings preferences.
<p>
If you are using a non-U.S. keyboard arrangment, you may want
adjust your keyboard handling using the &quot;altkeyhandler&quot;
and/or &quot;subkeyvalue&quot; config file options.  See the
<a href="../guidebook-360.html">Guidebook</a>
for more information.

<li><h3>Step 4: run.</h3>
<dl>
<dt>nethack.exe
<dd>for the tty interface
<dt>nethackw.exe
<dd>for the graphical interface
</dl>
Save and bone files are compatible between these two executables.

instructions and release notes.
