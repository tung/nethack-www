<li><h3>Step 2: unpack.</h3>
<br>
NetHack is shipped in a single archive created with tar and then
shrunk with gzip.  To unpack under Unix, the following commands
should be executed in an empty directory:
<pre>
        gzcat nethack-360-src.tgz &gt; nethack-360-src.tar
        tar xf nethack-360-src.tar
</pre>
Some versions of Linux do not have a gzcat command.  Use the following
commands instead:
<pre>
        gzip -dc nethack-360-src.tgz > nethack-360-src.tar
        tar xf nethack-360-src.tar
</pre>
<!--
<p>
If you intend to compile the NetHack sources for
a Windows CE target, then you also need to 
unzip nethack-360-ce-proj.zip into the sys/wince folder.
-->
<p>
The gzip package (containing gzip, gunzip, and gzcat) may be obtained from the
<a href="https://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>.  A version
of tar is also available from the same site.
<li><h3>Step 3: build.</h3>
See the file README in the top level directory unpacked in Step 2 for
build instructions for the various operating systems.
