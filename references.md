For that situation, I'd recommend a cloak of displacement and the
Tsurugi of Muramasa, or the Vorpal Blade, and a lot of luck.

Mjollnir might be helpful... anyone know if the T-Rex is shock
resistant? And if you have gauntlets of power, you can throw it
at him...

Neat trick: if you have on a pair of levitation boots at the
time, and gauntlets of power, and Mjollnir, you can throw Mjollnir
at him, get propelled backwards a couple squares, do about 6d6 
worth of electrical damage, and catch it on the rebound, getting
propelled backwards even more.

(Naturally, this trick is tailored for Valkyries).

Maybe I should check it out in Wizard Mode:

What's a good substitute for a T Rex... maybe a Chromatic Dragon?

Hmm. Thank goodness that was Wizard Mode, I've been killed 15 times
already, and I don't seem to be denting it. And it teleports.
Maybe there are better weapons than Mjollnir. (I guess it didn't
help that I was going about it with a 1st level character that
wasn't skilled in anything).

I just wished for Vorpal Blade, and the instakill kicked in, first
whack.

So, if you're jumped by a T Rex, or anything else for that matter,
the Tsurugi, or Vorpal Blade, is probably your weapon of choice,
depending on alignment.

If you're chaotic, you're out of luck, unless you have some hell-p.
Stormbringer's probably just too slow, although I'd like to see the
look on the T Rex's face when he found out just what Stormbringer
was doing... One of these days I'm going to have to do some coding
of my own, and implement Changeling, which should handle a T Rex;
heck, it should handle Godzilla.

The Tsurugi's good at that sort of thing. Bisection attack.
