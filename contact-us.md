## Reporting a bug in NetHack

Before sending us an email, check our <a href="{{ site.public_bug_tracker_url }}">public bug tracker</a> and the known bugs page of the version of NetHack that you are playing -- a work-around may already be available.

If the bug doesn't seem to exist yet, consider submitting it to the bug tracker instead of emailing it.  This will let you follow changes to your bug's status and discussion, and let others know that the bug exists and follow along too.

If you're having trouble using the bug tracker, send us an email with the following:

* **NetHack version** -- This can be found in the documention or by pressing `v` in the game.
* Bug details:
  * **What actions you were doing at the time of the bug.**
  * **What you expected would happen.**
  * **What actually happened instead.**

Also include as many of the following details as possible:

* **Download filename/link** -- From this website or the official project site.
* Software details:
  * **Operating system** -- Including the OS version.
  * **NetHack program filename you are running** -- e.g. `NetHack.exe` or `NetHackW.exe`.
  * **Compiler** (if building from source) -- Including the compiler version.
  * Any other software details you think may be relevant.
* Hardware details:
  * **Vendor**
  * **Model**
  * **Processor**
  * **Amount of memory**
  * **Amount of disk space**
  * Any other hardware details you think may be relevant.


## Website issues

Let us know if you find any broken links or out-of-date information; we will fix/update them as soon as we can.  Thanks!

If you find a **red link**{: style="color:#c00;text-decoration:underline"} that doesn't seem to do anything, that's a link to something we haven't gotten around to doing yet.  Feel free to bug us for updates on them though :).
